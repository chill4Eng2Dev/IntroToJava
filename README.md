# IntroToJava
**Book:** Introduction to Java Programming, 10th Edition, Y. Daniel Liang

**Description:** My intent of uploading these exercises is to practice .git and gitHub, general documentation using commenting, markdown language, and coding principles. I am using this book in my course material but college limits exposure due to time constraints. I am furthering my understanding and skills from the common advice of others in the Computer Science industry; practice. I may come back to previously completed problems to clean up the code with more sophisticated strategies while respecting material learned thus far to the exercise problem. Therefore, I will not use lessons learned in Chapter 10 to solve problems in Chapter 1.

**IDE:** jGRASP or BlueJ depending on modules needed. I am using these IDE's to force me into writing every bit of code without assistance. 

**Documentation:** My documentation methodology is based on the idea of having a complete problem within one file/folder (if possible). For example, I will retype the problem statement, the sample runs, and my thought process in the comments. In the same file (when applicable) I will show my solution. In addition, if there are visual aids such as Figures that must be referenced to expand an idea or that my output is to match, I will provide snap shots of these items within the exercise folder. Lastly, as I progress throughout this book, I may notice a code style I prefer and adjust old files to match the newly prefered style for consistency.
