# IntroToJava
**Book:** Introduction to Java Programming, 10th Edition, Y. Daniel Liang

**Description:** My intent of uploading these exercises is to practice .git and gitHub, code and general documentation, and coding principles. I am using this book in my course material but college limits exposure due to time constraints. I am trying to further progress my skills by the common advice; practice.
