/**
 * (Sort students) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of students,
 * the studentsâ€™ names, and their scores, and prints student names in decreasing
 * order of their scores.
 * 
 * Commentary: I will need to modify the selection sort to have two list passed through the
 * parameters. I will compare the score array elements to each other and sort accordingly,
 * while also sorting the names with the score sorts. I will print the arrays in descending
 * order after sorting as described in the problem statement.
