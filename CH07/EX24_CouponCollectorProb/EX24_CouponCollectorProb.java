/**
 * (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
 * problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from
 * a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
 * a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
 * before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
 * before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
 * to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
 * card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:
 *
 * ---------------------------------
 * Queen of Spades
 * 5 of Clubs
 * Queen of Hearts
 * 4 of Diamonds
 * Number of picks: 12
 * ---------------------------------
 *
 * Commentary: I will need to create (2) arrays, one for the deck and the other for the
 * four cards picked. I will need to shuffle the deck per the problem description. I will
 * then have (4) random cards picked and stored in an array. I will then need to check
 * if the (4) cards selected are of each suit. Based on the description, I believe the 
 * count incrementer is for each set of (4) cards selected. I will print output to 
 * match sample run.
