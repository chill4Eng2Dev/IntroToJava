/**
 * (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a university
 * is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition
 * will be $10,500. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and the
 * total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
 * 
 * Commentary: I am going to take the phrase "... and the total cost of four years' worth of
 * tuition after the tenth year." to exclude the tenth year and I'll need to sum years 11
 * through 14. In addition, I will assume I am to continue calculating compound growth after
 * the 10th year and add said values together. No required outputs were stated in the problem
 * so I will print the four year tuition calculation.
