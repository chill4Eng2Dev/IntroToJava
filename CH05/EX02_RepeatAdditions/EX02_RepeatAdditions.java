/**
 * (Repeat additions) Listing 5.4, SubtractionQuizLoop.java, generates five random
 * subtraction questions. Revise the program to generate ten random addition questions
 * for two integers between 1 and 15. Display the correct count and test time.
 *  
 * Commentary: I will need to copy Listing 5.4 code and adjust to become an addition
 * quiz. I will change the randomly generated numbers to be 1 to 15 inclusive. I will update
 * the number of questions allowed. I will remove the swap if statement as it is no longer
 * required. I will print output as shown in the listing.
