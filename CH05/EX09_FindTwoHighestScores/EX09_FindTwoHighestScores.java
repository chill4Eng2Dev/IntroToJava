/**
 * (Find the two highest scores) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 * number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the
 * student with the highest score and the student with the second-highest score.
 * 
 * Commentary: I will need to get user input to define how many iterations the for
 * loop will have. I will need to gather two inputs for each iteration from the user. 
 * These inputs will need to be compared with a "max" variable and this variable will
 * need to be updated if value is no longer max after updating the "second highest" 
 * student name and score. I will print the output as requested in the problem statement.
