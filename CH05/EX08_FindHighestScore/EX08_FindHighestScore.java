/**
 * (Find the highest score) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number
 * of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the name
 * of the student with the highest score.
 * 
 * Commentary: I will need to get user input to define how many iterations the for
 * loop will have. I will need to gather two inputs for each iteration from the user. 
 * These inputs will need to be compared with a "max" variable and this variable will
 * need to be updated if value is no longer max. I will print the output as requested
 * in the problem statement.
